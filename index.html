<h1>xilinux</h1>

<p>xilinux is a linux distro that currently has no reason to exist other than just a fun project of mine. Maybe it will do something unique to other distros in the future.</p>


<p>If you are interesting in setting up a repo, helping with development, maintaining the repos, or even just interested in this distro, contact davidovski at <a href="mailto:xi@davidovski.xyz">xi@davidovski.xyz</a> or on matrix <strong>davidovski@matrix.org</strong> Any help in any form would greatly be appreciated.</p>

<h2>This is davidovski's xilinux repo</h2>

<h3><strong><a href="/repo">Explore packages</a></strong></h3>

<p>This repo is a mirror of <a href="https://xi.davidovski.xyz">xi.davidovski.xyz</a>, the development build system for xilinux.</p>

<p>Currently there are no other build systems in action and all other "sources" are just mirrors of this one; being a development system, updates will only be made whenever I manually build all packages</p>
